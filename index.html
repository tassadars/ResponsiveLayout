        <p class="text">Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choosing). Set the background
          color of each section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). Make sure that the background color
          still allows the user to view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose,
          you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section
          and section title region that is 1px thick. Warning: While not specifying borders and colors according to the requirements
          does not hurt your grade so much, not doing so will make it much harder for your classmates to peer grade the rest
          of your assignment, possibly resulting in a much lower grade.</p>

        <p class="text">Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both
          horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser
          window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make
          sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins
          and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.)</p>

        <p class="text">Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck
          (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience! Don't get scared by the number of points
          below. It's really not so much. I just wanted to explain everything as clearly as I could and break it down into
          smaller steps.
